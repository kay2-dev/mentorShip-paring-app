# Mentorship Pairing Platform backend

## Overview

This application is a **Mentorship Pairing Platform** designed to connect mentors and mentees. It allows users to register, create profiles, send and receive mentorship requests, and (soon) book sessions and provide feedback. The backend is built with TypeScript, Express, and Drizzle ORM for PostgreSQL.

---

## Features

### 1. **User Registration & Authentication**
- Users can sign up as mentors, mentees, or admins.
- Secure authentication using JWT tokens.
- Passwords are hashed for security.

### 2. **Profile Management**
- Users create and update detailed profiles.
- Profiles include bio, skills, goals, and role (mentor/mentee/admin).

### 3. **Role-Based Access**
- The platform supports three roles:
  - **Mentor:** Can receive requests and set availability.
  - **Mentee:** Can send requests and book sessions.
  - **Admin:** Can manage users and oversee platform activity.

### 4. **Mentorship Requests**
- Mentees can send mentorship requests to mentors.
- Mentors can view incoming requests and accept or decline them.
- Request status is tracked (`pending`, `accepted`, `declined`).

### 5. **Request Management**
- Both mentors and mentees can view the status of their requests.
- Unique indexes prevent duplicate requests between the same mentor and mentee.

### 6. **Upcoming Features**
#### **Session Booking**
- Mentees will be able to book sessions with mentors based on mentor availability.
- Mentors set weekly availability blocks (e.g., Mondays 3â€“5pm).
- The system will prevent double-booking and manage session schedules.

#### **Feedback System**
- After a session, mentees can provide feedback and ratings for mentors.
- Feedback will be stored and visible in mentor profiles.
